# Rookie_learn_opencv
It is the beginning.

The whole code is divided into different parts. Considering we may install opencv in different place so the props is different, so I just upload the main cpp file. You can download it, and learn it by understanding my code and comment.

ATTENTION! There are some mistakes in it and I have comment on it. Hope you can help me solve it.

opencv410X64d.props IS the setting file I used.

Part 1 contains four parts:
1. the filter
2. the morphology
3. the resize
4. the edge_detect
